<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Dance Game</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>: I came creating a rhythm game using minim, because each beat will spawn a new ellipse. I am also going to use the makey-makey to recreate the board in which the feet step instead of using the keys. 

<strong>Description</strong>: This game is inspired by the dance games I see in the arcades. I like to recreate games I see in everyday life, and I thought this was a interesting yet a hard game to completely recreate. So this game will eventually have 4 circles and you have to use 4 keys to “combust” the boxes before they get off the page. Otherwise you die.
